Implementing Reinforcement Learning along with HTM for Proactive Behaviour

I'm not using spatial pooling as the task at hand is very minimal and does not require spatial pooling since it would not really improve my learning performance but add to the computing costs anyway. I am adopting a global pooler sort of approach.
